Development of EA Robot for Automated Trading
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build an Expert Advisor (EA) Robot that automates trading by using predictions generated from a machine learning (ML) model. The EA will operate in real-time, leveraging both historical and live data to make buy/sell decisions. Data can be obtained via two primary methods:
Additionally, the EA Robot will use an MQL5 script that defines the trading strategy, enabling automated trading on any MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. The core focus is to train an ML model for predictive trading, integrate data streams, and implement a scalable MQL5 strategy for execution.
Key Steps:
1. Project Setup
2. Data Retrieval and Preparation
3. Model Development and Training
4. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation
5. Real-Time Data Integration
6. MQL5 Script Development
